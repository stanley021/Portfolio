            <p class = "about-page">I am currently studying Honours Computer Science at Western University. I created this website portfolio using HTML, CSS, javascript and Node.js with Express (Weather App), to display my passion for programming. </p>

            <p class = "about-page">Ever since I built my own upgraded computer as a kid, I have loved and enjoyed working with technology. From building the computer all by myself, I came across many issues during the processâ€”and this problem solving process has led me to my passion for technology. I have always been curious about the possibilities of technology and would love to be at the forefront of developing capabilities for the future. </p>

            <p class = "about-page">Having attended many hackathons (Hack the Barriers, Western Hacks), it motivates me to meet minded individuals who are technologically curious and driven and to work in an innovative industry.</p>
