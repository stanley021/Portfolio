            <p class = "about-page">Hello, my name is Stanley Chen and I grew up in Toronto. I am currently studying Honours Computer Science at Western University with 
            thoughts of doing a minor in game development. This website is my portfolio that I have created using html,css and nodejs with express (Weather App), to show my abilities in programming and the progress 
            of my journey of passion. As a kid, I always knew that Computer Science was going to be my strongest subject, I enjoyed technology ever since I built my own beefy computer (GTX 980ti, i7-4790k, 16gb ddr3, 1tb samsung ssd). I built it all by myself and I came across a lot of issues 
            during that process and the reason i'm bringing this up is because in programming I enjoyed solving the problems that can occur, which has made me realized my own passion. 
            I've always wondered how far technology can go and I want to be apart of the advancement of technology and understand it's capabilites to a further extent. I have attended many hackathons(Hack the Barriers, Western Hacks) and I have met many others that have the same passion as me and it made me wish to 
            work in an environment revolving around technology. 
            If you are curious about the weather application it uses data from mapbox.com and darkskies api to search the weather of the location you desire.</p>
